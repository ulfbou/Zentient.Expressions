# Alfa Release Notes

This project is currently in alfa (pre-release) status. Alfa releases are intended for early validation and integration testing.

What to expect

- Public APIs are intentionally minimal to allow stabilization for beta.
- Packages published from release/* branches will use the branch label as the prerelease identifier (for example `0.1.0-alfa.ci.20250101.abcdef01`).
- Some packages may be provisional to support early consumption; see README.md for the provisional package note.

If you depend on these packages in CI, pin to the specific package version or to a tag to avoid surprises.
